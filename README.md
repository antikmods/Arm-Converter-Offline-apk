### #ArmConverter

**Arm Converter Offline** is an Android tool designed to **convert HEX â‡„ ARM** instructions.  
Supports **all ABIs (arm64, armv7, x86, x86_64)** and works **completely offline**.

---

## How It Works

Arm Converter Offline uses native JNI logic and integrates two open-source engines:  

- [Capstone Engine](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone) â€“ for disassembly (HEX â†’ ARM)  
- [Keystone Engine](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone) â€“ for assembly (ARM â†’ HEX)  

Everything runs natively on Android â€” **no PC required**.
